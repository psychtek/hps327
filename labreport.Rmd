## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
# Included librarys for functions
library(psych)
library(lm.beta)
library(haven)
library(papaja)
```

#import SPSS file into a data frame using the haven package
Reading SPSS-data with haven keeps the numeric values for variables and adds the value and variable labels as attributes. 

```{r}

well_being_df <- read_sav("WellbeingFINAL.sav")
View(well_being_df)
```

# Take a look at the data
```{r echo=TRUE}
describe(well_being_df)
```

#check for missing or na data
```{r}
which(is.na(well_being_df))
```


If number of observations with missing values are much lower than the total number of observations, then thereâ€™s not much loss of information by dropping them. 
```{r}
nrows <- nrow(well_being_df)
ncomplete <- sum(complete.cases(well_being_df))
ncomplete/nrows
```


#Subsetting each variable
```{r}
personality <- well_being_df[11:60]
cognition <- well_being_df[64:70]
affect <- well_being_df[61:63]
pwi <- well_being_df[4:10]
gender <- well_being_df[,2]
employment <- well_being_df[,3]
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
#Plotting the dependent variable distribution
pl1 <- ggplot(pwi, aes("well_being_df"))
pl1 + geom_density(fill = "red", alpha = "0.7")
```


# Look at the distribution 
```{r}
plot(well_being_df$Age)
hist(well_being_df$Age)
```
```{r}
PWI_index <- c(well_being_df$PWI1, well_being_df$PWI2, well_being_df$PWI3, well_being_df$PWI4, well_being_df$PWI5)
```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
