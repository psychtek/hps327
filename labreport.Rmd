## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
# Included librarys for functions
library(psych)
library(lm.beta)
library(haven)
<<<<<<< HEAD

```

#import SPSS file into a data frame using the haven package
```{r}

well_being_df <- read_sav("WellbeingFINAL.sav")
View(well_being_df)
```

# Take a look at the data
```{r}
describe(well_being_df)
```

#check for missing or na data
```{r}
which(is.na(well_being_df))
```


# Look at the distribution 
```{r}
plot(well_being_df$Age)
hist(well_being_df$Age)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
