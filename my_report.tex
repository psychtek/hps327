\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if
any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

\subsection{Data analysis}\label{data-analysis}

We used R (Version 3.5.1; R Core Team, 2018) and the R-packages
\emph{apaTables} (Version 2.0.5; Stanley, 2018), \emph{bindrcpp}
(Version 0.2.2; Müller, 2018), \emph{broom} (Version 0.5.0; Robinson \&
Hayes, 2018), \emph{car} (Version 3.0.2; Fox \& Weisberg, 2011; Fox,
Weisberg, \& Price, 2018), \emph{carData} (Version 3.0.1; Fox et al.,
2018), \emph{dplyr} (Version 0.7.6; Wickham, François, Henry, \& Müller,
2018), \emph{haven} (Version 1.1.2; Wickham \& Miller, 2018),
\emph{knitr} (Version 1.20; Xie, 2015), \emph{lmSupport} (Version
2.9.13; Curtin, 2018), \emph{MBESS} (Version 4.4.3; Kelley, 2018),
\emph{olsrr} (Version 0.5.1; Hebbali, 2018), \emph{papaja} (Version
0.1.0.9842; Aust \& Barth, 2018), \emph{psych} (Version 1.8.4; Revelle,
2018), and \emph{xtable} (Version 1.8.3; Dahl, Scott, Roosen, Magnusson,
\& Swinton, 2018) for all our analyses.

\textbf{\emph{Subjective Wellbeing}}. Wellbeing was assessed using the
Personality Wellbeing Index (PWI) to represent \enquote{life as a whole}
\{Cummins, 2003 \#547\} \{Group, 2013 \#567\}. The scale contains seven
domains of satisfaction that correspond to represent the overall
\enquote{How satisfied are you with life as whole?}. The domains are:
standard of living, health, achieving in life, relationships, safety,
community-connectedness, and future security. Participants indicated
their level of satisfaction with each domain using a 11-point Likert
scale ranging from 0 (No Satisfaction as all) to 10 (Completely
Satisfied). Composite variables were then computed to new variable and
labelled as PWI. Cronbachs alpha has been shown to yield small
reliability estimates therefore, a more reliable coefficient estimate,
omega will be used \{McNeish, 2017 \#532\}\{Dunn, 2013 \#531\}. Point
estimates and confidence intervals for the current sample were
\(\omega\) = 0.74, 95\% CI {[}0.65, 0.83{]}.

\textbf{\emph{Personality}}. Personality was assessed using a 50-item
pool from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP;\{Goldberg, 2006
\#566\} ) which, provides estimates for the Five Factor Model. The five
factors and reliability estimates were as follows: Neuroticism
\(\omega\) = 0.86, 95\% CI {[}0.81, 0.90{]}, Extraversion \(\omega\) =
0.88, 95\% CI {[}0.84, 0.92{]}, Openness \(\omega\) = 0.72, 95\% CI
{[}0.60, 0.83{]}, Agreeableness \(\omega\) = 0.82, 95\% CI {[}0.76,
0.87{]} and Conscientiousness \(\omega\) = 0.77, 95\% CI {[}0.70,
0.83{]}.

\textbf{\emph{Affect}}. The core construct of SWB is that of
Homeostatically Protected Mood based on Russell's (2003) Core Affect
\{Cummins, 2010 \#421\} \{Davern, 2007 \#417\}. Participants were asked
to describe their feelings across three areas of life in general: How
happy do you feel? How content do you feel? And How alert do you feel?
Each item was scored on a Likert rated as 0 (Not at all) to 10
(Extremely). The three items were averaged and a single variable was
computed reflecting homeostatically protected mood (HPMood). The
reliability of the item for this sample was \(\omega\) = 0.86, 95\% CI
{[}0.79, 0.92{]}.

\textbf{\emph{Cognition}}. Items from a revised version of Multiple
Discrepancies Theory (MDT) was used to evaluate perceived gaps between
the current self and various standards of comparison \{Michalos, 1985
\#569\}. This include: What one has and wants (self-wants); what
relevant others have (self-other); the best one has had in the past
(self-best); what one expected to have 3 years ago (selfprogress); what
one expects to have after 5 years (self-future); what one feels they
deserve (self-deserves), and what one feels they need (self-needs).
Items were averaged across each of the discrepancies to indicate a gap
between desired and actual life circumstances. Scores closer to zero
indicate less than desired circumstances, scores around five reflect
life circumstances close to the current desired level and, scores close
to 10 indicate actual circumstances are better than desired. A single
MDT variable was computed and the reliability of the items was
\(\omega\) = 0.78, 95\% CI {[}0.72, 0.85{]}.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Descriptives}\label{descriptives}

Means, standard deviations and correlations between variables are
presented below in Table 1. The wellbeing average was outside of the
normative range of scores (M = 68.80, SD = 10.50) as previous cohort
studies shows the average for a sample should fall between 73.43 - 76.43
points \{Cummins, 2010 \#421\}. Neuroticism (r = -.74, p
\textless{}.01), HPMood (r = .75, p \textless{}.01) and MDT (r = .60, p
\textless{}.01) were all strongly correlated with PWI. Extraversion (r=
.40, p \textless{}.01), Agreeableness (r = .27, p \textless{}.01) and
Conscientiousness (r = .29, p \textless{}.01) were all moderately
correlated with PWI.

deviation, respectively. Values in square brackets indicate the 95\%
confidence interval for each correlation. The confidence interval is a
plausible range of population correlations that could have caused the

\section{Regression}\label{regression}

A three stage hierarchical multiple regression was then conducted with
PWI as the dependent variable. HPMood was entered at stage one to
control for affect. MDT was entered at stage two and the five
personality traits entered as a group at stage three. Regression
statistics are presented below with associated change statistics, zero
order correlations and regression weights.

The hierarchical multiple regression revealed that at stage one, HPMood
contributed significantly to the model and accounted for 57\% of the
variation in subjective wellbeing \(R^2 = .57\), 90\% CI \([0.45\),
\(0.67]\), \(F(1, 99) = 131.06\), \(p < .001\). Introducing MDT at stage
two explained 58\% of the variance \(R^2 = .58\), 90\% CI \([0.46\),
\(0.67]\), \(F(2, 98) = 68.24\), \(p < .001\) in SWB however, the R2
change was not significant \(t(98) = 1.70\), \(p = .091\). The final
step introduced the personality traits: Neuroticism, Extraversion,
Openness, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness and explained an
additional 10\% of the variance in SWB \(R^2 = .68\), 90\% CI \([0.56\),
\(0.75]\), \(F(7, 93) = 28.80\), \(p < .001\). The final step accounted
for 68\% of the variance in SWB. In the final adjusted model two out of
the seven predictors were statistically significant. Neuroticism had the
higher magnitude of effect \(b = -0.65\), 95\% CI \([-0.92\),
\(-0.38]\), \(t(93) = -4.84\), \(p < .001\) and the strongest unique
contribution to the overall model explaining 8\% of the variance in SWB.
HPMood \(b = 2.83\), 95\% CI \([1.27\), \(4.39]\), \(t(93) = 3.61\),
\(p = .001\) provided the next strongest effect size and uniquely
explained 4\% of the variance in SWB.

Further exploratory model was then conducted excluding non-significant
coefficients. A multiple regression analysis showed that HPMood and
Neuroticism significantly predicted SWB (\(R^2 = .66\), 90\% CI
\([0.56\), \(0.74]\), \(F(2, 98) = 97.02\), \(p < .001\)) and accounted
for 66\% of the variance in SWB. HPMood proved to have the strongest
effect (\(\beta = 3.65\), 95\% CI \([2.40\), \(4.90]\),
\(t(98) = 5.80\), \(p < .001\)) accounting for 12\% of the unique
variance in SWB followed by Neuroticism (\(\beta = -.69\), 95\% CI
\([-.95\), \(-.43]\), \(t(98) = -5.26\), \(p < .001\)) which contributed
9\% of the unique variance.
